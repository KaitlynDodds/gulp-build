## Setup Instructions 

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

Uses `gulp 4.0.0`. Local and global installation versions need to be the same.

```
$ npm -g gulp --version
to check global version

$ npm gulp --version
to check local version
```

**Treehouse Project Tasks (meet requirements):**  

* `gulp styles`
* `gulp scripts`
* `gulp clean`
* `gulp images`
* `gulp build`
* `gulp` default

**Build Prod Worthy Dist**

* `gulp build:prod`


# Gulp Build

In this project you’ll be provided a website with HTML, SCSS, JPEGs, PNGs and JavaScript files. You’ll be required to set up a Gulp build process to prepare the website for deployment.

The build process must fulfill the following criteria:

* Concatenate and minify the JavaScript files

* Compile SCSS into CSS in a concatenated and minified file

* Generate JavaScript and CSS source maps

* Compress any JPEG or PNG files

## Project Instructions 

* As a developer, I should be able to run the `npm install` command to install all of the dependencies for the build process.

* As a developer, I should be able to run the `gulp scripts` command at the command line to concatenate, minify, and copy all of the project’s JavaScript files into an `all.min.js` file that is then copied to the `dist/scripts` folder.

* As a developer, I should be able to run the `gulp styles` command at the command line to compile the project’s SCSS files into CSS, then concatenate and minify into an `all.min.css` file that is then copied to the `dist/styles` folder.

* As a developer, when I run the `gulp scripts` or `gulp styles` commands at the command line, source maps are generated for the JavaScript and CSS files respectively.

* As a developer, I should be able to run the `gulp images` command at the command line to optimize the size of the project’s JPEG and PNG files, and then copy those optimized images to the `dist/content` folder.

* As a developer, I should be able to run the `gulp clean` command at the command line to delete all of the files and folders in the `dist` folder.

* As a developer, I should be able to run the `gulp build` command at the command line to run the `clean`, `scripts`, `styles`, and `images` tasks with confidence that the clean task completes before the other commands.

* As a developer, I should be able to run the `gulp` command at the command line to run the build task and serve my project using a local web server.

## Extra Credit

* As a developer, when I run the `default gulp` command, it should continuously watch for changes to any `.scss` file in my project. When there is a change to one of the `.scss` files, the `gulp styles` command is run and the files are compiled, concatenated, and minified to the `dist` folder. My project should then reload in the browser, displaying the changes.
